Generic single-database configuration.

## Database migration

Alembic (the migration framework used by Flask-Migrate) will make these schema changes in a way that does not require the database to be recreated from scratch.

To accomplish this seemingly difficult task, Alembic maintains a migration repository, which is a directory in which it stores its migration scripts. Each time a change is made to the database schema, a migration script is added to the repository with the details of the change. To apply the migrations to a database, these migration scripts are executed in the sequence they were created.

### Create the migration repository (already done)
```bash
flask db init
```

### Generate a migration

To generate a migration automatically, Alembic compares the database schema as defined by the database models, against the actual database schema currently used in the database. It then populates the migration script with the changes necessary to make the database schema match the application models

```bash
flask db migrate -m "MIGRATION MESSAGE HERE"
```

### Database Upgrade and Downgrade Workflow

#### Database upgrade

When you are ready to release the new version of the application to your production server, all you need to do is grab the updated version of your application, which will include the new migration script, and run :

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

Alembic will detect that the production database is not updated to the latest revision of the schema, and run all the new migration scripts that were created after the previous release


#### Database downgrade

If you need to undoes the last migration, run :

```bash
flask db downgrade
```

#### Database model creation

You need to specify a Foreign key name when you create a new model in database_models.py file.

Naming convention => fk_tableName_columnName

Example (group_id foreign key of group table column id in study case table) :
```
group_id = Column(Integer,
                  ForeignKey(f'{Group.__tablename__}.id',
                             ondelete="CASCADE",
                             name='fk_study_case_group_id'),
                  nullable=False)
```
